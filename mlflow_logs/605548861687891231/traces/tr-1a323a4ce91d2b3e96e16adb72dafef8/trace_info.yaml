  "Okay, the user wants to buy the Sonic Zap Trap. Let me check the steps again. First,
  I need to make sure I''ve asked about their problem with roadrunners, which I did.
  Then I mentioned the product, which they liked. The price was $999,999, and I added
  a caveat about the pet roadrunner. Now, since they said yes, I should execute the
  order. The function execute_order requires product and price. The product is \"Sonic
  Zap Trap\" and price is 999999. I need to call the execute_order function with these
  parameters. Let me format that correctly.\n"}}], "created": 1765082591, "model":
