  user wants to place an order for a black boot. Let me check the available functions.
  There''s a function called place_order that requires the item_name. The user specified
  \"black boot,\" so I should use that as the item name. I need to make sure the parameters
  are correctly formatted. The function doesn''t ask for color separately, just the
  item name. So I''ll call place_order with \"black boot\" as the item_name. That
  should cover it. Let me structure the tool call properly.\n"}}], "created": 1765040380,
