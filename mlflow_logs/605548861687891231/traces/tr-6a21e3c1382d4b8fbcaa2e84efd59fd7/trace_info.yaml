  the user initially asked to place an order for a black boot, and I successfully
  processed that. Now they''re saying they want a refund. Let me check the tools available.
  There''s an execute_refund function that requires the item name. Since the order
  was for a black boot, I need to call that function with \"black boot\" as the item_name.
  I should make sure to use the correct parameters and function name. No other tools
  are available, so this is the right approach. Let me structure the tool call accordingly.\n"}}],
